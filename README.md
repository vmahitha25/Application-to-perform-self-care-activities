Traditional mental health services are highly effective but cannot be scaled up to meet the growing demands of those affected. 
Conversational agents, also known as chatbots, are a recent development that have been effectively applied to the field of mental health care as a scalable platform for cross-platform smartphone applications to offer such people first-level help. 
The proposed Application provides the users with an interface which includes functionalities such as a conversational chatbot, sharing your story, a list of pleasant selfcare activities, mindful games & exercises to keep the users engaged.
It allows users to perform self-care activities in times of need. Helps the users measure their stress level according to the Perceived Stress Scale by answering a stress questionnaire and provides users with a platform where they can have friendly conversations with a chatbot as well as share the story about their journey with other users.
